# Shay Ben Simon's Chatbot

Welcome to Elon chatbot!

For implementing the chatbot I used Lit as you recommend, Node.js, Express and Socket.IO.

## How to run?

1. Clone this repository by: `git clone git@github.com:shaybs247/chatbot.git`
2. Run `yarn` in the root folder and in the `server` folder.
3. Copy `.env` you got from me in the email into the `server` folder.
4. Copy the mongodb certificate you have received in the email into `server/cert`.
5. Run `yarn start` on both root _folder_ and server _folder_
